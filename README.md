Hi. I'm Zachary. I can code in:
- C#
- Python

I am a student, so I am learning still, so if I make mistakes, please let me know so I can fix them.

Since I am a student, don't ask me for professional advice since I'm not a professional just yet.

I am the owner of the TermBrowse and RSSReader repos. Both are terminal-based programs, but have a simple navigation scheme. Both are built in Python 3.12.

I also own the VR-Theater repository, which allow you to view movies in a virtual reality environment with nothing but your phone and a controller.

Current Projects:
- VR Theater
  - An app that allows you to view your movies in a virtual theater.
