# Hello!
Hi. I'm HydeZero.
I can code in:
- C#
- Python

Don't ask me for professional advice since I'm not a professional at these languages yet.

I am the owner of the TermBrowse and RSSReader repos. Both are terminal-based programs, but have a simple navigation scheme. Both are built in Python 3.12.

Current Projects:
- ZeroEPUB
  - A good EPUB reader application for Windows and Linux.

That is all that's happening right now. See you later.
