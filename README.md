# HydeZero
Hi. I'm HydeZero.
I can code in:
- C#
- Python

Don't ask me for professional advice since I'm not a professional at these languages yet.

I am the owner of the TermBrowse and RSSReader repos. Both are terminal-based programs, but have a simple navigation scheme. Both are built in Python 3.12.

Current Projects:
- MP3Sync
  - A simple proof of concept app that basically takes your music library, converts it into MP3, and transfers it to your MP3 player via file copying.
