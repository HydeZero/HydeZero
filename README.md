Hi. I'm Zachary. I can code in:
- C#
- Python

I am a student, so I am learning still, so if I make mistakes, please let me know so I can fix them.

Since I am a student, don't ask me for professional advice since I'm not a professional just yet.

I am the owner of the TermBrowse and RSSReader repos. Both are terminal-based programs, but have a simple navigation scheme. Both are built in Python 3.12.

Current Projects:
- MP3Sync
  - A simple proof of concept app that basically takes your music library, converts it into MP3, and transfers it to your MP3 player via file copying.
